        Python is a high-level, interpreted programming language with dynamic semantics. 
        It was created by Guido van Rossum and first released in 1991. Python's design 
        philosophy emphasizes code readability with its notable use of significant whitespace. 
        Its language constructs and object-oriented approach aim to help programmers write 
        clear, logical code for small and large-scale projects. Python is dynamically-typed 
        and garbage-collected. It supports multiple programming paradigms, including structured, 
        object-oriented and functional programming. Python is often described as a "batteries 
        included" language due to its comprehensive standard library. It is used for web 
        development, data science, artificial intelligence, automation, and many other applications.
